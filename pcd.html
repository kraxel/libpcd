<h1>libpcd - a library for reading PhotoCD images</h1>

<em>doc is really incomplete</em>

<h2>1. Overview and basic functions</h2>
<dl>
<dt><tt>pcd_open</tt><dd>Open a file for reading
<dt><tt>pcd_select</tt><dd>Select resolution and area for decoding, set some
options. Allocates required memory.
<dt><tt>pcd_decode</tt><dd>Does the huffmann decoding (for 4BASE and 16BASE)
<dt><tt>pcd_get_image</tt><dd>Transforms the PhotoCD's YUV coding to
RGB/GRAY, various output formats are possible.
<dt><tt>pcd_get_image_line</tt><dd>dito, but allows reading the image
line by line.
<dt><tt>pcd_close</tt><dd>Close file.
</dl>
The <tt>pcd_select</tt>, <tt>pcd_decode</tt>, <tt>pcd_get_imgdata</tt>
cycle can run more than once with different parameters without
reopening the file.
<p>
There are few other functions and useful macros, see the Documentation
below for details. You may have a look to the test/example
applications too.


<h2>2. Detailed library description</h2>

TODO


<h2>3. Library TODO List</h2>
<ul>
<li>write documentation
<li>add more sanity checks. Currently it is no problem to crash the
library. However, it should'nt happen for normal usage (i.e. calling
everything in order, don't try to read jpeg images etc...)
<li>provide error-codes (errno-like)
<li>maybe add 64BASE (6144x4096, PhotoCD Pro) resolution support
</ul>
